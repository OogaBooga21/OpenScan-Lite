# OpenScan-Lite  
An Arduino-based branch of the OpenScan project.  

---

## Overview  
OpenScan-Lite is a simpler, cheaper version of OpenScan Classic with fewer features.  
Its primary purpose is to program and pose the object you are scanning.  

### Key Points:  
- **It does NOT program picture-taking** (you'll need to handle this separately) (Some Options given bellow).  
- Functions as a glorified stand to automate scanning movements.  

---

## Features  
- Controlled via the Serial Monitor: (in the arduino IDE)
  - Press **1** to start scanning.  
  - Press **2** to stop scanning.  
- Designed for affordability and DIY customization.

## What You Need  

### Hardware:  
1. **2 stepper motors**  
2. **2 stepper motor drivers**  
3. **1 Arduino board**  
4. **1 capacitor** *(optional but highly recommended)*  
5. **12V 5A Power Supply Unit (PSU)**  
   - A weaker PSU might work, but it is not recommended.

## How to Build  

### 1. **Download and 3D-Print the Structure**  
Youâ€™ll need only the structural files from the OpenScan Classic project.  
Get the files from this link:  
[OpenScan Classic Files](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScan-Design/tree/main/files/Classic/V1).  

Required parts:  
- **Adapter1**  
- **Adapter2 gear large**  
- **Gear Small** *(2 versions available; try both to see which works best)*  
- **Rotary arm**  
- **Stand1** and **Stand2**  
- Any required turntable attachments.  

**Skip any files related to Raspberry Pi.**

### 2. **Build the Circuit**  
Follow the wiring instructions provided in the Arduino code and use this tutorial as a reference:  
[Stepper Motors and Arduino Guide](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/stepper-motors-and-arduino-the-ultimate-guide/).  

#### Wiring Overview:  
- **Table Stepper:**  
  - Pin **2** â†’ Direction  
  - Pin **3** â†’ Step  

- **Stand Stepper:**  
  - Pin **9** â†’ Direction  
  - Pin **10** â†’ Step  

The code assumes both stepper motors are set to **1/16 microstepping mode**.  
If you wire them differently, update the code accordingly.  
Refer to the tutorial above for guidance on using stepper motors with drivers and setting the microstepping mode.

should look somethign like this

### 3. **Install a OpenCamera App (Optional)**  
If using a programmable camera, you can skip this step. Otherwise:  
- Download the OpenCamera app on your phone.
- This app can be programmed to take photos at specific intervals.  
- The default code changes positions every **3 seconds**, so configure OpenCamera accordingly.  

---

### 4. **Optional: Build a Phone Stand**  
If using a smartphone, ensure it remains steady for around 10 minutes.  
- Use a phone stand like this:  
  [Thingiverse Phone Stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363730).  
- Alternatively, build any stand you find suitable.  

---

## Software  

After capturing the pictures, save them on your phone or computer.  
Here are some options for processing your scanned images:  

1. **[OpenScanCloud](https://www.openscancloud.com/):**  
   - Best results with minimal effort.  

2. **[Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom):**  
   - Great for advanced users who want more control over the process.  

3. **[ColMap](https://colmap.github.io/):**  
   - Another powerful option worth trying.

## Customization Ideas  

This implementation is intentionally barebones, so feel free to experiment and enhance it:  
- Replace the **OpenCamera app** with a Bluetooth module and trigger the phone using an app like **Dabble**.  
- Upgrade the Arduino to an HID-capable device for more advanced features.
